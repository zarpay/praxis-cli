# Audit Framework Health

> Proactively audit the framework for issues and propose fixes.

## Objective

2. Verify cross-references (all paths in frontmatter point to existing files)
3. Audit for staleness

5. Validate responsibilities index
6. Check naming conventions (kebab-case)
7. Report findings

## Criteria

- [ ] All documents reviewed against their templates
- [ ] All cross-references verified
- [ ] Responsibilities index complete and accurate
- [ ] Issues documented with clear explanations
