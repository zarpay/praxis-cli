# Guide Content Placement

> Help contributors understand where content belongs and how to structure it.

## Objective

When someone wants to add or modify content in Praxis, guide them to the right place and format.

## Trigger

A contributor asks for help with:
- "Where does this belong?"
- "How should I structure this?"
- "Does this already exist somewhere?"

## Process

1. **Understand the content** — What is the contributor trying to capture?
2. **Identify the primitive** — Context, Roles, Responsibilities, or Reference?
3. **Refine placement** — Which subcategory within the primitive?
4. **Check for duplicates** — Does similar content already exist?
5. **Guide structure** — Help them follow the appropriate template

## Criteria

- [ ] Contributor understands where their content belongs
- [ ] Placement follows framework primitives correctly
- [ ] Naming conventions followed
- [ ] No duplicate content created
