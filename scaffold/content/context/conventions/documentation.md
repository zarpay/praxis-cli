# Documentation Convention

> Replace this with your organization's documentation standards.

## General Principles

- Every document should be self-contained enough to understand without context
- Be economical — every word should earn its place
- Write for both humans and agents

## Formatting

- Use markdown with YAML frontmatter
- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Include required frontmatter fields for the document type
