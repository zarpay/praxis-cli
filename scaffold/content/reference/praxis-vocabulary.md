## The Four Primitives

### Context
> "This is who we are and how we think."
Foundational understanding. Subdivided into Constitution (immutable) and Conventions (standards).

### Roles
> "This is who you are."
Defines identity, scope, and boundaries of a contributor.

### Responsibilities
> "This is what you own."
Discrete pieces of work delegated to a Role. Owned, not just executed.

### Reference
> "This is what things mean."
Static, factual information consulted as needed.

## Key Concepts

### Loading Model
Layered approach to providing context:
1. **Always loaded**: Constitution, Conventions, assigned Role
2. **Per assignment**: The specific Responsibility
3. **As needed**: Reference materials

### Delegation vs Prompting

| Prompting | Delegating |
|-----------|------------|
| You specify every step | You specify the outcome |
| The LLM executes | The agent owns |
| You are accountable | The agent is accountable |
