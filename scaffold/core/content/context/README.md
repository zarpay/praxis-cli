# Context

> **"This is who we are and how we think."**

Context provides the foundational understanding that every contributor — human or agent — needs before doing any work.

## Structure

### [Constitution](./constitution/)

Immutable identity documents. These change rarely.

### [Conventions](./conventions/)

Standards and norms for how we work together. These evolve as we learn.

### [Lenses](./lenses/)

Mental models that shape how we understand the world and approach problems. These capture ways of thinking.

## Loading Pattern

**Always load Constitution** — Every contributor needs organizational identity.

**Load relevant Conventions** — Based on the work being done.

**Load relevant Lenses** — Based on the domain you're working in.
